# Observing the Biblical Calendar with the Naked Eye

This guide explains how to determine the new moons, feast days, and the beginning of the Hebrew year using only your eyes and observation of the sky - no internet, apps, or calculations required.

## The Basics

The biblical calendar is based on three observable phenomena:
1. **The Moon** - determines months
2. **The Sun** - determines days (sunset to sunset)
3. **The Barley Harvest** - determines the start of the year

---

## Part 1: Determining the New Moon (Start of Each Month)

### What You're Looking For

The new month begins when you first see the **thin crescent moon** in the western sky just after sunset. This is NOT the completely dark "astronomical new moon" - it's the first visible sliver of light.

### When to Look

1. **Time**: 15-45 minutes after sunset
2. **Direction**: Western sky, where the sun just set
3. **Position**: The crescent will be low on the horizon, slightly south (left in Northern Hemisphere) of where the sun set

### The Observation Process

#### Step 1: Track the Moon's Cycle
Watch the moon throughout the month:
- **Full moon**: Bright, round disc visible all night
- **Waning**: Moon rises later each night, shrinks on the left side
- **Last quarter**: Half moon, rises around midnight
- **Waning crescent**: Thin crescent visible in eastern sky before dawn
- **Dark moon**: Moon invisible for 1-3 days (too close to sun)
- **New crescent**: First sliver appears in western sky after sunset - **THIS IS THE NEW MONTH**

#### Step 2: Know When to Expect It
The lunar cycle is approximately 29.5 days. After seeing a new crescent:
- Count 28 days, then start watching
- The next crescent will appear on day 29 or 30

#### Step 3: Finding the Crescent

**What it looks like:**
- Very thin curved sliver (like a fingernail clipping)
- Only 1-3% of the moon's surface is lit
- Horns (points) face upward and away from the horizon
- May have a faint glow on the dark portion (earthshine)

**Where to look:**
```
                    *  <- crescent will be here
                   *
     -----------*------ horizon
        [sunset point]
```

The crescent appears:
- 5-15 degrees above the horizon (about one fist-width at arm's length)
- Within 15 degrees of where the sun set

### Observation Conditions

**Good conditions:**
- Clear sky near western horizon
- Low humidity and haze
- High altitude or coastal locations (clear horizon)
- Dark site away from city lights

**Poor conditions:**
- Clouds near horizon
- Heavy haze or dust
- Mountains or buildings blocking western view
- Bright city lights

### What If You Miss It?

If you can't see the crescent on the expected evening due to weather or conditions:
- The month is declared to have 30 days
- Look again the next evening
- The month NEVER exceeds 30 days

### The Two-Witness Principle

Historically, two reliable witnesses were required to confirm the new moon sighting. If possible:
- Have another person observe with you
- Compare what you both saw
- Note the exact time and position

---

## Part 2: Counting the Days of the Month

Once you've sighted the new crescent, that evening begins **Day 1** of the new month.

### Day Structure

Biblical days run from **evening to evening**:
- Evening (sunset) to evening (next sunset) = one complete day
- The night comes FIRST, then the daylight portion

```
Day 1:
  [sunset]----[night]----[sunrise]----[day]----[sunset]
     ^                                            ^
   Day 1 BEGINS                              Day 2 BEGINS
```

### Counting for Feasts

From the new moon (Day 1), count forward:

| Day of Month | How to Count |
|--------------|--------------|
| Day 1 | New moon evening (crescent sighted) |
| Day 2 | Next sunset |
| Day 3 | Following sunset |
| ... | Continue counting sunsets |
| Day 14 | 13 sunsets after the new moon |

---

## Part 3: The Sabbaths

### Weekly Sabbath
The weekly Sabbath occurs every 7th day, from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset.

### Monthly Sabbaths (New Moon Model)
In this calendar system:
1. The **new moon day** is a Sabbath
2. Additional Sabbaths fall every **7 days** after the new moon
3. This means Sabbaths fall on days: 1, 8, 15, 22, (29)

---

## Part 4: Determining the Start of the Year (Nisan 1)

The biblical year begins in spring with the month of **Nisan** (also called Aviv). Two conditions must be met:

### Condition 1: The Barley Must Be "Aviv"

**What is Aviv barley?**
- Barley that has matured enough that the heads are full but still green
- Can be roasted and eaten (parched grain)
- Will be ready for harvest within 2-3 weeks

**How to check:**
1. In late winter (February-March in Israel), examine barley fields
2. Look at the barley heads:
   - **Too early**: Heads still forming, grains soft and milky
   - **Aviv (ready)**: Heads full, grains firm but still green, can be parched
   - **Too late**: Heads golden/brown, grains hard and dry

### Condition 2: A New Moon Must Be Sighted

Once you find aviv barley:
- Wait for the next new crescent moon
- That evening begins **Nisan 1** - the first day of the new year

### What If Barley Isn't Ready?

If the barley is not yet aviv when the 12th month ends:
- Add a **13th month** (leap month)
- Wait for the next new moon
- Check the barley again
- This keeps Passover in spring when barley is ready for the wave sheaf offering

### Regional Barley Observation

The barley in the land of Israel (particularly the Jordan Valley and coastal plains) traditionally determines the year:
- Jordan Valley ripens first (late February - early March)
- Coastal plains ripen next
- Hill country ripens last

If you're not in Israel, you can:
1. Use reports from observers in Israel
2. Note that Nisan typically falls in March or early April

## Part 5: The Feast Days

Once you know when Nisan 1 is, you can calculate all the feast days:

### Spring Feasts (Month 1 - Nisan)

| Feast | When | How to Determine |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **Passover** | Nisan 14 | Count 14 sunsets from new moon |
| **Unleavened Bread** | Nisan 15-21 | Day after Passover, lasts 7 days |
| **Firstfruits** | Nisan 16 | Day after the Sabbath during Unleavened Bread |

### Late Spring Feast (Month 3 - Sivan)

| Feast | When | How to Determine |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **Shavuot/Pentecost** | Sivan 6 | Count 50 days from Firstfruits (Nisan 16) |

### Fall Feasts (Month 7 - Tishrei)

Count 7 new moons from Nisan to find Tishrei:

| Feast | When | How to Determine |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **Feast of Trumpets** | Tishrei 1 | The 7th new moon from Nisan |
| **Day of Atonement** | Tishrei 10 | 9 sunsets after Trumpets |
| **Feast of Tabernacles** | Tishrei 15-22 | 14 sunsets after Trumpets, lasts 8 days |

### Winter Feast (Month 9 - Kislev/Tevet)

| Feast | When | How to Determine |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **Hanukkah** | Kislev 25 - Tevet 2 | Count 9 new moons from Nisan, then count 25 days |

### Late Winter Feast (Month 12 - Adar)

| Feast | When | How to Determine |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **Purim** | Adar 14-15 | Count 12 new moons from Nisan (or 13 in leap year), then count 14 days |

---

## Part 6: Leap Years

### How to Know If It's a Leap Year

A leap year is needed when:
1. The barley won't be aviv by Passover (Nisan 14)
2. OR the 7th new moon from Nisan falls in late August (Aug 20-31)

### The Late August Rule

This observational rule works without checking barley:
1. Count 7 new moons from Nisan
2. If the 7th new moon falls **August 20-31**, it's a leap year
3. The 7th moon becomes a leap month, and the 8th moon is Tishrei

### Leap Year Effect on Feasts

In a leap year:
- Spring feasts are unaffected
- Fall feasts occur about a month later
- Purim is celebrated in month 13 (Adar), not month 12

## Part 8: Practical Tips

### Building Your Observation Skills

1. **Practice monthly**: Watch for every new moon, even if just for practice
2. **Keep a journal**: Record date, time, conditions, and what you saw
3. **Note failures too**: Record when you couldn't see it and why

### Equipment That Helps (But Isn't Required)

- Binoculars (7x50 are ideal) - makes spotting easier but not essential
- Compass - helps find exact west
- Watch - to note sunset and sighting times
- Notebook - for recording observations

### Teaching Others

The calendar was meant to be observed by communities:
1. Teach children to watch with you
2. Share sightings with neighbors
3. Establish local observation points with clear western views

---

## Summary

The biblical calendar requires only:
1. **Eyes** to see the moon and barley
2. **Patience** to watch and count
3. **Community** to confirm sightings

No internet, no calculations, no apps - just careful observation of the creation as it was designed to be observed.
